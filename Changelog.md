### `0.50.0` â€” November 27, 2019

###### BREAKING

**A complete overhaul.** The Slate codebase has had a complete overhaul and many pieces of its core architecture have been reconsidered from the ground up. There are lots of changes. We recommend re-reading the [Walkthroughs](https://docs.slatejs.org/walkthroughs) and [Concepts](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts) documentation and the [Examples](../../site/examples) to get a sense for everything that has changed. As well as the [Migration](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/XX-migrating) writeup for what the major changes are.
